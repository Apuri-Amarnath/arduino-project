# Arduino Keypad Control System with LCD Display

This Arduino sketch is designed to control a keypad system using analog and digital pins, with output displayed on an LCD display. It reads analog values from four different pins connected to infrared sensors and maps them to digital values. Based on the combination of digital values read, it determines which key in the keypad system is pressed and displays the corresponding action on the LCD display.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Infrared sensors (IR receivers and IR senders)
- Buzzer
- LCD display
- Resistors (if needed for IR sensors)
- Wiring connections

## Installation

1. Connect the IR receivers and IR senders to the analog pins defined in the sketch (`analogPin1`, `analogPin2`, `analogPin3`, `analogPin4`).
2. Connect the digital pins defined in the sketch (`digitalPin1`, `digitalPin2`, `digitalPin3`, `digitalPin4`) to the keypad system.
3. Connect the buzzer to the pin defined in the sketch (`buzzer`).
4. Connect the LCD display to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board. Make sure to adjust the sketch if necessary to match your wiring configuration.
5. Connect the Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

## Usage

1. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or any compatible IDE.
2. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE (`Tools` > `Serial Monitor`) or press `Ctrl + Shift + M`.
3. Press keys on the keypad system to trigger actions.
4. View the output messages on the LCD display.
5. Additionally, view detailed output messages in the serial monitor for debugging or logging purposes.
6. Based on the key combinations pressed, the Arduino will execute corresponding actions and display messages on the LCD display.

## Additional Notes

- Adjust the delay timings, buzzer activation, and LCD display configurations as needed based on your specific requirements.
- Ensure proper wiring connections and component setup to avoid errors and malfunctions.
